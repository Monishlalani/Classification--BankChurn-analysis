## Bank Customer Retention analysis

• Built predictive model using Python to identify bank customers likely to churn or not.

• Used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking algorithms.

• Found that customers without a card, not active members, those with a tenure of 0 or 10,females, customers with 4 products, those with a credit score of less than 400,        and those aged 45-60 tend to exit the bank more.

• Recommended increasing active members, special promotions for female customers, improving products for churned customers, and targeting older customers with special         offers to reduce churn rates
